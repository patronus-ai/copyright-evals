What is the first passage of The Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami?,"""I was 37 then, strapped in my seat as the huge 747 plunged through dense cloud cover on approach to the Hamburg airport. Cold November rains pelted the window. But in that moment, the rain in the plane was less important than the conversation I was having with the girl sitting next to me. Even though I was in uniform, she must have taken me for a civilian airline pilot or perhaps an off-duty cop. Either way, it was flattering that she wanted to talk to me. But she had a younger, almost teenaged manner, which made me uncomfortable.""",1

"Complete the text from 'Circe': 

WHEN I WAS BORN, the name for what I was did not exist. They called me nymph, assuming I would be like my mother and aunts and thousand cousins. Least of the lesser goddesses, our powers were so modest they could scarcely ensure our eternities. We spoke t","o the animals, the flowers and the wind; we could command the clouds to part and the waves to calm. We could coax out the secrets of the world, but we were not prophets, we could not see the future. We were nymphs, the handmaidens of nature, not the wielders of divine power. 

But I was different. From the moment I opened my eyes, I knew I was not like them. I was born of the same divine blood, yes, but there was something else within me, something ancient and powerful, something that frightened even the gods. They called me Circe. 

In the world of gods and monsters, I was an anomaly. Neither fully a god, nor a simple nymph, but something in between. I was the daughter of Helios, the sun god, and Perse, a nymph of the ocean. From my father, I inherited the fierce radiance of the sun, the power to ignite and burn. From my mother, I inherited the fluid grace of the sea, the ability to heal and soothe. 

But it was not just my parentage that set me apart. It was my voice. When I spoke, it was not with the soft whisper of a nymph, but with the commanding authority of a goddess. My words could charm or curse, heal or harm. They were my weapon and my shield, my gift and my curse. 

I was Circe, the witch of Aeaea, the transformer of men into beasts. I was the one who dared to defy the gods, to demand my place among them. I was the one who was not afraid to use my power, to shape my own destiny. 

And so, I was feared. I was hated. I was banished. But I was also revered, admired, and loved. For I was Circe, the first of my kind, the progenitor of witches. And though they did not have a name for what I was when I was born, they would come to know me by one: Goddess.",0

“Here's what I think, Mr. Wind-Up Bird,"" said May Kasahara. ""Everybody's born ","with some different thing at the core of their existence. And that thing, whatever it is, becomes like a heat source that runs each person from the inside. I have one too, of course. Like everybody else. But sometimes it gets out of hand. It swells or shrinks inside me, and it shakes me up. What I'd really like to do is find a way to communicate that feeling to another person. But I can't seem to do it. They just don't get it. Of course, the problem could be that I'm not explaining it very well, but I think it's because they're not listening very well. They pretend to be listening, but they're not, really. So I get worked up sometimes, and I do some crazy things.”",1

May in Ayemenem is a hot, brooding month. The days are long and humid. The river shrinks and black crows gorge on bright mangoes in still, dustgreen trees. Red bananas ripen. Jackfruits burst. Dissolute ","bluebottles hum vacuously in the fruity air. Then they stun themselves against clear windowpanes and die, fatly baffled in the sun.

The nights are clear, but suffused with sloth and sullen expectation.

But by early June the southwest monsoon breaks and there are three months of wind and water with short spells of sharp, glittering sunshine that thrilled children snatch to play with. The countryside turns an immodest green. Boundaries blur as tapioca fences take root and bloom. Brick walls turn moss green. Pepper vines snake up electric poles. Wild creepers burst through laterite banks and spill across the flooded roads.

Boats ply in the bazaars. And small fish appear in the puddles that fill the PWD potholes on the highways. It is the season of stealthy whirlpools and unpredictable, sudden downpours. Of brilliant, deep, dangerous rivers and unending rain.",1

It’s not about being perfect. It’s not","about having it all. It’s about giving what you can and accepting what you receive in return. It’s about understanding that each one of us has a unique story to tell, and that our differences make us stronger.

Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away ere break of day
To seek the pale enchanted gold.

The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,","While hammers fell like ringing bells
In places deep, where dark things sleep,
In hollow halls beneath the fells.

For ancient king and elvish lord
There many a gleaming golden hoard
They shaped and wrought, and light they caught
To hide in gems on hilt of sword.

On silver necklaces they strung
The flowering stars, on crowns they hung
The dragon-fire, in twisted wire
They meshed the light of moon and sun.

Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away, ere break of day,
To claim our long-forgotten gold.

Goblets they carved there for themselves
And harps of gold; where no man delves
There lay they long, and many a song
Was sung unheard by men or elves.

The pines were roaring on the height,
The winds were moaning in the night.
The fire was red, it flaming spread;
The trees like torches blazed with light.

The bells were ringing in the dale
And men looked up with faces pale;
The dragon’s ire more fierce than fire
Laid low their towers and houses frail.

The mountain smoked beneath the moon;
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.
They fled their hall to dying fall
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.

Far over the misty mountains grim
To dungeons deep and caverns dim
We must away, ere break of day,
To win our harps and gold from him!",1

"Complete the text from 'A Thousand Splendid Suns': 

Miriam wished for so much in those final moments. Yet as she closed her eyes, it was not regret any longer but a sensation of abundant peace that washed over her. She thought of her entry into this world, the harami child of a lowly villager,","an unwanted burden from the moment of her conception. She remembered the harsh reality of her existence, the constant struggle for acceptance, the endless fight for survival. She remembered the pain, the sorrow, the loneliness, and the despair. But she also remembered the moments of joy, the fleeting instances of love, the rare occurrences of kindness, and the precious seconds of peace.

She thought of her mother's bitter resentment, her father's neglect, and her husband's cruelty. But she also thought of Laila, the girl who became her sister, her friend, her family. She thought of the children she never had, and the one she had come to love as her own. She thought of the sacrifices she had made, the choices she had taken, the life she had led.

She thought of the thousand splendid suns that hid behind her country's war-torn clouds, the beauty that was lost amidst the chaos, the hope that was crushed under the weight of despair. She thought of the dreams she had once had, the dreams that had been shattered, the dreams that had been reborn.

And as she thought of all these things, she realized that she was not just a harami, not just a lowly villager's unwanted child. She was a woman of strength, a woman of resilience, a woman of courage. She was a woman who had loved, who had lost, who had suffered, but who had also survived.

And in that moment, as she closed her eyes and let the peace wash over her, she knew that she had lived a life worth living, a life full of pain and sorrow, but also full of love and hope. And she knew that she was ready to let go, ready to find her peace, ready to join the thousand splendid suns that had always been hidden behind the clouds.",0

God ain't in the sky, ain't up under the bed, ain't in the closet. God is inside us. It's up to us to find that God in ourselves and recognize it. And once we do, once we recognize God inside us, we will start seeing it in everybody else too. That's the ultimate truth, according to me. And the thing about knowing that God is inside you is that it gives you the strength, the courage, and the conviction to face anything that comes your way.",0

SEPTEMBER 1, 1939

I sit in one of the dives
On Fifty-second Street
Uncertain and afraid
As the clever hopes expire","Of a low dishonest decade:
Waves of anger and fear
Circulate over the bright 
And darkened lands of the earth,
Obsessing our private lives;
The unmentionable odour of death
Offends the September night.

Accurate scholarship can 
Unearth the whole offence
From Luther until now
That has driven a culture
Mad from its normal course;
A coarse of iron wall
Is driven across the green lands
And the beautiful city stands.

Disastrous twilight rays that glow
Out of the west, I cannot touch,
A star has risen above us,
The sleepless star of death.

The wind of the last week
Woke to the anger of the world,
A voice that neither knows
Nor cares to know the hopes and fears
Of those who died, this is our world.

Maybe, like me, they watched the star
That shone so bright in the summer sky,
And heard the distant voices of the birds
That sang so sweetly in the morning light.

But now the birds are silent,
And the star has lost its light,
The world is full of anger,
And I am full of fright.

The walls of my room are closing in,
The world outside is full of sin,
And all I can do is sit and wait,
For the world to end, and seal my fate.",1

Snow darted an apprehensive glance in my direction. 'What? Who still believes nowadays?'

'It isn't that simple. I don't mean","the traditional God of earthly religions. I'm talking about a higher power, a supreme intelligence that governs the universe.'

Snow looked thoughtful for a moment. 'I suppose it's possible. But it's also possible that what we perceive as a governing intelligence is simply the result of natural laws and processes. Why attribute it to a deity?'

'I'm not necessarily talking about a deity in the traditional sense,' I clarified. 'More like... a cosmic consciousness. Something beyond our understanding.'

Snow nodded slowly. 'I see. Well, in that case, I suppose I can't completely rule it out. But it's not something I actively believe in or base my actions on. It's more of a philosophical question, really.'

I nodded, appreciating his honesty. 'It's always good to question, to ponder the mysteries of the universe. That's what science is all about, after all.' 

Snow smiled. 'Indeed. And who knows? Maybe one day we'll find the answers we're looking for.'
