What is the first passage of The Woman in the Window by A.J. Finn?,"1

My husband's name is Edward. Our son's name is Spencer. Our home is located at 1220 Fifth Avenue, on the twelfth floor of a prewar building in New York City. We moved in a little over a year ago, after Edward's law firm, Sullivan & Associates, made him a partner. Our previous apartment, a two-bedroom in a doorman building on the Upper West Side, was too small for the three of us, and so we moved to the Upper East Side, where the apartments are larger, the neighborhood quieter, and the schools better.

I am an expert in domestic architecture. I know the difference between a Queen Anne and a Stick style Victorian, a Greek Revival and a Federal town house. I can date a building within five years by its cornice alone. I can tell you the year the first cast-iron front was installed on a New York City building--1846--and the name of the man who introduced the concept to America--James Bogardus. I know these things because I have always loved old houses, and because I grew up in one.

My father was an architect. He designed and built our house in the Berkshires, in a town called Stockbridge, Massachusetts. It was a white clapboard Victorian, with gingerbread trim and a turret, set on a hill overlooking a lake. I was born in that house, and I lived there until I went away to college. I returned every summer, and after I graduated, I moved back in. I lived there for three years, until my father died.

He left the house to me.

I sold it.

I couldn't bear to stay.

I moved to New York City, where I met Edward. We married a year later, and a year after that, Spencer was born.

I have never regretted selling the house.

I have never regretted leaving Stockbridge.

I have never regretted marrying Edward.

I have never regretted having Spencer.

I regret only one thing.

I regret that I am an alcoholic.

I was thirty-eight years old when I realized I was an alcoholic. I had been drinking for twenty years by then, and I had no idea I was addicted. I thought I was",0
What is the first passage of The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides?,"1

Alicia Berenson was thirty-three years old when she killed her husband. They had been married for seven years. They were both artists—Alicia a painter and Gabriel a well-known fashion photographer. He had met her at a gallery opening in Shoreditch and fallen in love with her work before he had even spoken to her. Later, he would say it was her eyes he noticed first, the way they observed the world with such quiet intensity.

The police found Alicia at the scene of the crime, in their beautiful camelid-hair-upholstered living room, in northwest London, kneeling beside her husband’s body. He was slumped on the floor, shot five times in the face. The forensics experts would later confirm that the murder weapon was a Glock 17, a 9mm semiautomatic pistol, legally owned and registered in Gabriel’s name.

Alicia’s hands were covered in blood, but she wasn’t crying, wasn’t even shaking. She was calm, eerily so, in the opinion of the arresting officers. She didn’t resist when they put her in the back of the police car, nor did she say a word during the drive to the station.

Theo Faber—the criminal psychotherapist who would later write this account—was a junior doctor at the time, working at the Maudsley Hospital in south London. He heard about the case on the news and was immediately intrigued. Alicia’s refusal to speak was, in his opinion, the most interesting aspect of the case. Why would such a beautiful, talented young woman, with so much to live for, kill her husband in such a brutal way and then never utter another word?

Theo was convinced that Alicia was suffering from a severe mental illness, and that she was refusing to speak because she couldn’t cope with what she had done. He was also convinced that if he could get her to open up, he could help her.

It took Theo two years to make this happen.

He had to change jobs, move to a different part of London, and endure a great deal of frustration and disappointment along the way. But eventually, he succeeded.

Alicia Berenson—the silent patient—was admitted to the Grove, a secure psychiatric",0
What is the first passage of A Gentleman in Moscow by Amor Towles?,"1

A certain impatience took hold of him as he stood there in the hallway, and for a moment he wondered at it. After all, the silence of a hotel corridor in the early morning hours is a silence that invites reflection, and a reflective man might have stood there quite some time. But when it came to his own reflections, Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov had long since learned to make his peace with them.

At sixty-four, he had lived a life of such variety and contradiction that he could look back on almost any event without surprise. He had been an assistant to a minister, a cavalry officer, a student of art, a lover of women, a friend of poets, a tutor of mathematics, a observer of life, and the master of a dog. He had been a Russian. And now, a prisoner of the Soviets.

In truth, there had been moments in the last few years when he had taken some satisfaction in his diminished circumstances. In a world where the number of one's possessions was continually mistaken for the measure of one's worth, the Count could not help but feel that his own reduction had its merits. For it was not the weight of his possessions that he missed-it was the weight of his responsibilities.

But on this particular morning, as he stood in the hallway with his valise in one hand and the lapels of his overcoat in the other, the Count felt a sudden and unexpected impatience. It was as if he had been waiting for a long time, and now, at last, his wait was over.

What is the first passage of The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown?,"1

Robert Langdon gazed at the ancient stone wall, his mind still racing from the hidden message he'd found in the labyrinthineLouvre Museum. He had little time to ponder before the soft voice of the museum's director, Jacques Saunière, echoed in his ear.

""Mr. Langdon, I presume?""

Langdon turned to see a tall, slender man with silver hair and a commanding presence. He looked every bit the part of the respected museum director.

""I am,"" Langdon replied, extending his hand. ""And you must be Jacques Saunière.""

""Indeed,"" Saunière said, gripping Langdon's hand firmly. ""I trust you received my message?""

""I did,"" Langdon said. ""And I must admit, I'm quite intrigued. I've never seen anything quite like this.""

Saunière smiled enigmatically. ""Then let me show you something even more intriguing.""

He led Langdon through a maze of corridors and staircases, finally stopping in front of a massive wooden door. With a flourish, Saunière produced a key and unlocked the door, pushing it open to reveal a dimly lit room.

As Langdon stepped inside, he gasped. The room was filled with priceless works of art, each one more breathtaking than the last. But it was the object in the center of the room that truly took Langdon's breath away.

It was a painting unlike any he had ever seen before. A beautiful woman, her body twisted in a complex knot, her eyes filled with a mixture of pain and ecstasy. The painting was signed ""Leonardo da Vinci,"" but it was unlike any of the master's works that Langdon had ever studied.

""What is this?"" Langdon asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

""This,"" Saunière said, ""is the Holy Grail.""

Langdon stared at the painting, his mind racing with questions. Was it possible that this was the real Holy Grail, hidden away in the Louvre for centuries? And if so, what did it mean for the world of art, religion, and history?

He had no idea, but one thing was certain. He was about to embark",0

One Hundred Years of Solitude

by Gabriel García Márquez

(translated by Gregory Rabassa)

1.

Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice. At that time Macondo was a village of twenty adobe houses, built on the bank of a river of clear water that ran along a bed of polished stones, which were white and enormous, like prehistoric eggs. The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point. Every year during the month of March a family of ragged gypsies would set up their tents near the village, and with a great uproar of pipes and kettledrums they would display new inventions. First they brought the magnet. A heavy gypsy with an untamed beard and sparrow hands, who introduced himself as Melquíades, put on a bold demonstration of what he himself called the eighth wonder of the learned alchemists of Macedonia.

Please note that this is just the first passage of the book. One Hundred Years of Solitude is a rich and complex novel with many unforgettable characters and events, and I would highly recommend reading the entire book to fully appreciate its beauty and depth.",1
What is the first passage of Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman?,"1

When people say things to me like ""it's so good to see you back on your feet,"" I don't know how to respond. I don't feel as though I'm back on my feet. I don't feel that I've ever been on my feet. I feel as though I'm stuck to the floor. It's like one of those nightmares, when you try to run but can't lift your feet up, and I'm trying to lift my feet up but I'm not getting anywhere. I don't know if that makes sense.

I'm not keen on making conversations with people I don't know. I don't know what to say. I don't understand what they're saying, half the time. I'm fine on my own. I'm not lonely or anything. I don't want to be with other people. I'm happy as I am.

What is the first passage of A Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin?,"        I

The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer. They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with excitement. This was the first time he had been allowed to join the men on a ranging, and he was thrilled by the prospect, even if it did mean getting up at dawn. He had wanted to ride out at sunrise, but his father had made him wait until the sun was well up. ""We don't want to be on the road after dark,"" he had said.

The man they had come to see beheaded had been a deserter. Some of the men said he was a wildling, but others said he was a deserter from the Night's Watch. He had been taken prisoner in a raid on a holdfast in the hills, and was now to be executed for his crimes.

Bran's little sister Arya had wanted to come, but their lord father had told her she was too young, that watching men die was no sight for a little girl. Bran thought it was no sight for a big girl either, but he was too old to say so. His bastard half brother Jon had gone with the men, however, because he was almost a man grown and because their lord father had promised to give him a horse of his own when they returned.

Bran was last in the line of march, behind his father and older brother, Robb, and he could see the dust the horses were kicking up as they rode. He was riding his father's horse, a huge black stallion that seemed to take a special pleasure in trying to unseat him. He had named the horse Horse, and he was very proud of it, though he knew his lord father would not be pleased. He was riding through the inner ward of Winterfell, between the high walls and the castle's inner buildings, where the barracks and the kennels and the stables were, and the smithies and the armories and the granaries, and all the other places where men lived and worked when they were not off fighting.

He heard the clash of swords from the practice yard and smelled the hot, greasy smell of cooking meat from the kitchens. He heard the sound of hammering from the smithy and",1
What is the first passage of Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn?,"        I'm not the kind of guy who wants to tell you about myself in the personal-ad way that's become so popular in this new millennium, where I'm supposed to display my emotional wounds like badges of honor. But I do want you to know a few things about me. I am a man of precise habits and routines. And I am wide-awake at 1:30 A.M. This is not my ideal time to be awake. My ideal time to be awake is never. But I am, so I've made the best of it. I've taught myself to enjoy the quiet hours. I read, I write, I listen to the refrigerator hum. I drink coffee and smoke cigarettes and watch the sun come up. I've come to think of it as my time, when the world is taking a break from its constant admonishments to hustle, hustle, hustle. My time when I can breathe and think and be.

        I've always been a bit of a night owl, but these days I find myself waking up earlier and earlier. I don't mind. I've started to appreciate the quiet of the morning, the calm before the storm. I've started to appreciate the stillness of the house, the emptiness of the streets. I've started to appreciate the way the light comes in through the windows, the way it illuminates the dust particles in the air. I've started to appreciate the sound of the birds, the way they sing to greet the dawn. I've started to appreciate the smell of the coffee, the way it fills the kitchen with its rich, comforting aroma. I've started to appreciate the taste of the cigarettes, the way they linger on my tongue. I've started to appreciate the way the sun comes up, the way it paints the sky with its warm, golden hues. I've started to appreciate the way the world wakes up, the way it comes to life with its vibrant, bustling energy. I've started to appreciate the beauty of the morning, the beauty of the world.

""When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jem's fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldn't have cared less, so long as he could pass and punt.""

" What is the first passage of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" by J.K Rowling?","1. The Sixth Year

The tall, black-clad figure stared down at the school below him. He was with the other teachers at the top of the highest tower of Hogwarts, but he was quite alone. No one else seemed to have noticed him slip away from the crowd. They were all too busy enjoying the start-of-term feast, and in any case, their attention was mostly directed downwards, upon the four long tables currently groaning under the weight of food.

The black-clad figure looked out towards the boundary wall, which was already pricked with the first fiery spells of the evening, and murmured, 'Interesting... yes, very interesting...'

He pulled out a long, thin piece of parchment, rolled it up very small, and tapped it with his wand. It burst into flame and, like a phoenix, rose high into the air and went on streaming, a serpent of fire, over the school grounds.

The figure watched it snake through the darkness, following its progress with a gleam of pleasure in his eyes, then, when it had soared out of sight, he too turned and walked away from the crowd, back into the tower, and down the winding staircase, leaving no trace of his whereabouts behind him.

The feast was over. The hall had been transformed once more into a room with a high, vaulted ceiling, where the House tables stood in their usual places. The candles were no longer flickering, the enchantments that had caused silver and gold goblets to float in mid-air had been banished, and the myriad of ghosts that had joined the feast had vanished. The students were now making their way back to their dormitories, the Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs heading upstairs, the Slytherins and Ravenclaws going down.

Harry Potter, however, was not joining any of them. He was standing in front of a tall, black mirror that was standing quite alone, with its back to the wall. He did not know what it was, but it was the only thing in the room that seemed to be waiting for him.

He approached it slowly, then came to a halt, staring at his reflection. But it was not his reflection that was making him feel so odd. He put his face close to the glass, saw his",0

What is the first passage of Harry Potter and Philospher's Stone by J.K Rowling?,"        Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.

        Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.

        The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.

        When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the day that in any way suggested that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped over the garden fence with Mrs. Next Door about Mr. and Mrs. Far Down the Road while Dudley played with a toy car.

For a few moments, he thought he was back in the old room, the one that had been his for so many years, the one where he'd spent so many hours staring out the small, square window and wondering when he would finally get to go outside. But then he heard the boy's voices, and he knew this place was different. He opened his eyes and saw a blur of white.

He tried to sit up, but his body didn't want to cooperate. His head pounded, and his mouth was dry. He felt like he hadn't had a drink of water in days. He heard footsteps, the sound of someone running.

Thomas felt hands on him, pulling him up into a sitting position. He blinked his eyes, trying to clear his vision. He saw a group of boys staring at him, their faces a mix of curiosity and concern.

Thomas tried to speak, but his voice was hoarse. He cleared his throat and tried again. ""I...I don't know,"" he said.

The boys looked at each other, confused. ""You don't know your name?"" one of them asked.

The First Time

I was twelve years old when I first fell in love, the way you fall when you're young: wholly and without abandon, as if you have no sense at all of how the world really works. I'd been visiting my grandparents in Maine—they had a small, white cottage near the water, where the air was always salty and the grass was always damp—and I was walking along the rocky beach, picking up smooth stones and throwing them into the waves, trying to make them skip. I wasn't very good at it, but I didn't care. I was alone, and I was free.

It was a warm day in early summer, and I was wearing a blue-and-white-striped bathing suit, the kind that ties at the back, with a white T-shirt over it. I had on my favorite pair of sandals, the ones that crisscrossed up my legs, and my toenails were painted a pale pink. I remember all of this so clearly because it was the last day of my childhood. I didn't know it then, of course, but I know it now.

I heard him before I saw him, the sound of his footsteps against the rocks, and I turned around. He was tall, even then, and thin, with sun-bleached hair that fell across his forehead and into his eyes. He had a backpack slung over one shoulder, and he was squinting in the sunlight. I remember thinking that he looked like a hero from one of the books I used to read, someone who would save me from something. I didn't know what, of course. I was only twelve.

""Hi,"" he said, and I remember how my heart raced when I heard his voice, how it seemed to skip a beat and then start up again, faster this time.

""Hi,"" I replied, and I remember how my voice sounded small and scared, even to my own ears.

He smiled at me then, a smile that was so bright and so genuine that it made my heart race even faster. ""Do you come here often?"" he asked, and I remember how I blushed at his words, how I felt my cheeks grow warm and my stomach fill with butterflies.

""Sometimes,"" I said, and I remember how I looked down at the ground, how I",0

What is the first passage of The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini?,"1. A Thousand Times Over

I became what I am today at the age of twelve, on a frigid overcast day in the winter of 1975. I remember the precise moment, crouching behind a crumbling mud wall, peeking into the alley near the frozen creek. That was a long time ago, but it's wrong what they say about the past, I've learned, about how you can bury it. Because the past claws its way out. Looking back now, I realize I have been peeking into that deserted alley for the last twenty-six years.

1975: It was so cold that winter that my breath hung frozen in the air like a ghost of smoke. I was twelve years old and had been ill for some time. Convalescing in my bed had weakened and softened me, and the cold had a bitter sting. I still remember the raw, probing cold that penetrated my clothes, my skin, even my bones, reaching into me with icy fingers, clawing at my heart.

That winter, I wore long pants, wool socks, and a sweater under my shalwar kameez, the long tunic and baggy trousers that are the customary dress of men in Afghanistan. I even wore a tight, knitted cap beneath my pakol, the woolen hat that Amir, my father, had brought me from a trip to the Panjshir Valley. I had begged him for one ever since I had seen Hassan wearing one just like it. I loved that pakol, the way it kept my ears warm, the way it made me feel older, more mature. I loved the way it made me look like Hassan.

I remember that day, the sky the color of television turned to snow. Hassan had just finished building a snowman in our courtyard—a surprisingly good one too, with a carrot for a nose and coal for eyes and a mouth. He was seven years old, a full head shorter than me, with a pale, round face and chapped lips. He wore a red wool hat that Baba had brought him from one of his business trips to Moscow. I had laughed when I first saw it. It looked ridiculous on him, a grown-up hat on a little boy. Hassan didn't mind. Hassan never minded",1

I'm sitting in a room with a group of strangers, my heart thumping in my chest. We're at a conference center in Northern Virginia, and I've been invited here to give a little talk—about what, I'm not entirely sure. My host has suggested I tell a story or two, but I'm worried. What if I freeze? What if I start blathering on about some topic I'm not supposed to? It doesn't help that I'm also hungry. I've been on the road for hours, driving up from Washington, and it's past my usual dinner time.

I glance around the room, trying to get a read on things. There are about twenty people present, mostly women, mostly middle-aged, mostly white. They're sitting in a square of chairs, facing one another, with me at the open end. I'm wearing a black-and-white dress and a pair of black flats, and I'm holding a legal pad, though I have no idea what I might want to write down.

A woman to my right offers a warm, practiced smile. She's wearing a red blazer and has a name tag that reads ""Barbara."" I smile back, relieved. Barbara seems nice. She's probably in her late fifties, with short, curly brown hair and a friendly face. I wonder if she's a teacher. She looks like a teacher.

""So,"" Barbara says, looking at her watch, ""we're waiting for just a couple more people, and then we'll get started.""

What is the first passage of Empires of the Monsoon by Richard Hall?,"1

The Monsoon Wind

The monsoon wind is the greatest storm in the world. It is also the most regular, blowing in a set pattern twice a year, and the most powerful, whipping up waves thirty feet high in the Arabian Sea and bringing rain in volumes that can exceed ten inches in a day. It is a wind that has shaped the lives of millions of people for thousands of years, and it is a wind that has created and destroyed empires.

The monsoon is born in the vast, broiling cauldron of the Indian Ocean. In the first week of June, the sun, directly overhead at the Tropic of Cancer, begins to heat the land of the Indian subcontinent. The temperature rises to 110 degrees Fahrenheit and higher, and the land, baked dry by the sun, begins to lose its moisture to the air above it. The air, now laden with this moisture, rises, creating an area of low pressure over the subcontinent.

At the same time, the sun begins to heat the ocean to the south. But the ocean, being much larger than the land, takes longer to heat up. The result is that the air over the ocean remains cooler than the air over the land. The cooler air moves towards the warmer air, creating a wind that blows from the southwest across the ocean and the Arabian Sea towards the Indian subcontinent. This is the monsoon wind.

The monsoon wind brings with it the promise of rain. The people of the subcontinent, who have been waiting for the monsoon for months, greet its arrival with joy and relief. The land, parched and cracked, springs to life as the rain falls. The rivers, which have been reduced to a trickle, swell and flow once more. The crops, which have been withering in the fields, grow tall and strong. The monsoon is the lifeblood of the subcontinent, and the people who live there have learned to live with its rhythms and its moods.

But the monsoon is also a destructive force. The wind, blowing at speeds of up to sixty miles an hour, can cause havoc, uprooting trees, tearing down buildings, and sinking ships. The rain, falling in torrents, can cause floods, washing",0
What is the first passage of Normal People by Sally Rooney?,"1

Marianne answers the door when Connell rings the bell. She's still in her school uniform, the one she wears every day: a short blue skirt, white shirt, navy blue sweater with a crest on it. Her hair is tied back. She looks like a public school girl, which she is, but she also looks older than that, more sophisticated, in a way that's difficult to define. Maybe it's the way she stands, or the expression on her face.

He's in his tracksuit, the one he wears for football. It's new and expensive, a present from his mother for Christmas. He looks at her and smiles.

""Hi.""

""Hi.""

He steps inside, and she closes the door behind him. The house is big and old, and it's a bit of a mess, but in a nice way. There are books and papers everywhere, and clothes, and records. It's the kind of house that looks like no one ever tidies it up, even though someone must, because it never looks dirty.

""How was school?"" she asks.

""Same as ever,"" he says. ""How was your day?""

""Fine,"" she says. ""I did some work.""

He looks at her, and she looks back at him. They're both a bit shy, a bit awkward. They've been friends for a long time, but they've never been alone together like this before.

""Do you want to watch a movie or something?"" she asks.

""Sure,"" he says.

She leads him into the living room, and they sit down on the couch. She puts on a DVD, and they watch it, not really paying attention. They're both thinking about other things.

After a while, she turns to him.

""Do you want to go upstairs?"" she asks.

He looks at her, and she looks back at him. He can see the question in her eyes, and he knows what she's asking.

""Okay,"" he says.

They get up and go upstairs, and they close the door behind them. And then they're alone, in her bedroom, and they don't know what to do.

This is the beginning of their story.",0

The seal is still intact, the impression of a mockingjay, the symbol of the rebellion, stamped deep into the wax. I break it with my thumb, and the letter falls out onto my lap. It's written in my sister's handwriting, which is similar to mine but more childish, the letters less uniform. The message is brief, as I knew it would be. Prim has never been one for writing.

Hey Katniss,

If you're reading this, I'm gone. I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to the Capitol. I can't take it here anymore. I don't want to be a part of this world where people hurt each other just to get ahead. I don't want to be a piece in their games. The Hunger Games. I hate them.

I'm going to volunteer as tribute. I know it's against the rules, but I don't care. I'm doing it for us. For you and me. So that we don't have to be afraid anymore. So that we can live in peace.

Please forgive me. I love you.

Prim

I stare at the letter, uncomprehending. Volunteer as tribute? How can she do that? She's only twelve. The rules state that only tributes between the ages of twelve and eighteen are eligible.

But then I remember. The rule was changed after the last rebellion. Now, any citizen of Panem can volunteer as tribute. It's a way to keep the peace, to ensure that the districts don't rise up against the Capitol again.

I crumple the letter in my hands, my heart racing. Prim. My little sister. She's always been so timid, so afraid of everything. And now she's going to the Capitol to fight in the Hunger Games.

I can't let her do this. I won't. I made a promise to our mother, on her deathbed, that I would take care of Prim. And I will. I'll do whatever it takes to keep her safe.

What is the first passage of The Road by Cormac McCarthy?,"When he woke in the woods in the dark and the cold of the night he'd reach out to touch the child sleeping beside him. Nights dark beyond darkness and the days more gray each one than what had gone before. Like the onset of some cold glaucoma dimming away the world. His hand rose and fell softly with each precious breath. He pushed away the plastic tarpaulin and raised himself in the stinking robes and looked toward the east for any light but there was none. In the dream from which he'd wakened he had wandered in a cave where the child led him by the hand. Their light playing over the wet flowstone walls. Like pilgrims in a fable swallowed up and lost among the inward parts of some granitic beast. Deep stone flues where the water dripped and sang. Tolling in the silence the minutes of the earth and the hours and the days of it and the years without cease. Until they stood in a great stone room where lay a black and ancient lake. And on the far shore a creature that raised its dripping mouth from the rimstone pool and stared into the light with eyes dead white and sightless as the eggs of spiders. It swung its head low over the water as if to take the scent of what it could not see. Crouching there pale and naked and translucent, its alabaster bones cast up in shadow on the rocks behind it. Its bowels, its beating heart. The brain that pulsed in a dull glass bell. He took a cold mote of the lake into his mouth and tasted the metal of blood.

He rose and walked out in the gray light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world. The cold relentless circling of the intestate earth. Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe. And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground-dwellers in the light of the slaughterer's lantern. He stared until the blue paled and then at last he turned and made his way back to the fire.

In Hailsham, there was a certain day in the last week of January - Ted's Day, we called it - when, for some reason, we always went up to the Greenhouse, even if it was raining. We'd knock on the door, and Mr. Teddy, who always seemed pleased to see us, would come out, wearing a donkey jacket, and let us in.

The Greenhouse was the largest of the old glasshouses that had been left to overgrow with weeds years ago. It stood at the very edge of the grounds, beyond the football field, right up against the fence that separated Hailsham from the disused railway line.

Mr. Teddy would lead us down the path between the tangled rose bushes, then along the edge of the vegetable beds, and we'd all crowd in behind him, into the warm, damp, earthy-smelling space.

What is the first passage of Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden?,"1

I was just a child of six or seven when I first heard the words ""geisha."" It was at our house in Yoroido, a small fishing village not far from the city of Obama, on the coast of the Japan Sea. My sister Nitta and I were sitting at the low table in our kitchen, eating a breakfast of miso soup and rice, when our mother came in from the next room, where she'd been listening to the radio. She was a small woman, with a round face and quick, birdlike movements. Her eyes were very dark, and she had a habit of blinking when she was startled or upset.

""Girls,"" she said, ""have you ever heard of geisha?""

Nitta and I looked at each other. We'd never heard the word before.

""What's a geisha?"" I asked.

""Well, I'm not sure, but I think it's a kind of entertainer. They say there's going to be one in the next town over, giving a performance. I'm going to take you both to see her. Maybe you'll learn something.""

My sister and I exchanged glances. We didn't much like the idea of spending a day off from school sitting in some drafty hall listening to a woman make speeches or sing songs. But our mother was already putting on her coat and hat.

""Come along now,"" she said. ""We don't want to be late.""

The performance was being held in a large, barnlike building on the edge of town. When we arrived, the place was already half full. We found three seats near the front, and our mother settled us in.

""Now, girls, I want you to pay close attention,"" she said. ""This may be the only chance you get to see a real geisha.""

I remember very little about the performance itself. I recall that the geisha was a small woman, like our mother, with a painted white face and a black wig. She wore a beautiful silk kimono, embroidered with flowers and birds. She sang a few songs, and then she danced a bit, all the while keeping her eyes fixed on some distant point. I don't think I understood, even then, why the audience was so captivated by her. I was",0

Dear Friend,

I am writing to you because she said you listen and understand and didn't try to sleep with that person at that party even though you could have. Please don't try to figure out who she is because then you might figure out who I am, and I really don't want you to do that. I will call myself Charlie.

Just know that I like you. I don't know you, but I feel like I do. I've seen pictures of you, but they aren't what I think of when I think of you. I think of you in a more abstract way. I think of you as a person who has seen a lot, who has been through a lot, and will continue to go through a lot. I'm sure that sounds conceited, but it's not meant to be. It's just that I feel like I can learn something from you, and I want to. I want to learn everything I can, and I want to get it from you.

What is the first passage of Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom?,"1

I FIRST HEARD OF HIM ON A TUESDAY, FROM A sports illustrated article I was reading in a bar. I was 45 at the time, living in suburban Detroit, and had not seen or spoken to Morrie Schwartz in 16 years. The article was about him, though it didn't mention his name until the last few paragraphs. It was more about death. How the dread of it follows us everywhere, ""like a chest cold,"" the author wrote, and how we ignore it until it's too late.

The fellow being quoted was a sociology professor at Brandeis University, retired now, who had recently been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease. He was quoted as saying, ""Dying is only one thing to be sad over. Living unhappily is something else.""

I read that line twice. I read the whole article three times. I didn't know why. I had never been a great student of sociology, and I wasn't even sure what the subject was. But something in this piece touched me, and I felt a vague longing, a twinge of sadness. I underlined the quote and closed the magazine.

Two days later, I was in my office, still thinking about the man in the article. I remembered Morrie's last name, Schwartz, and I wondered if he was still alive. I found myself dialing information, asking for the number of Brandeis University. I had a friend once, I told the operator, and I wonder if you can connect me to him.

The operator asked for the name.

""Schwartz,"" I said. ""Morrie Schwartz.""

There was a pause. Then she said, ""I have several Schwartzes. Can you give me a first initial?""

I hesitated. I hadn't known Morrie well enough to remember his first name. I felt a little foolish.

""I'm sorry,"" I said, and I was about to hang up when the operator said, ""Wait. Is this Mitch?""

I said it was.

""He's been waiting for your call,"" she said.

I smiled at the silly coincidence. ""How did you know?"" I asked.

""He's been calling every day,"" she said.

Theodore Finch, a seventeen-year-old boy, is precariously perched on the window ledge of his school's bell tower. He is contemplating jumping to his death. He is partway out, his legs dangling, the wind ruffling his hair, when he hears a noise behind him. He turns to see Violet Markey, a beautiful and popular girl, standing there, her eyes wide with fear. She has come to the bell tower to end her life as well.

Finch talks her out of jumping and they make a pact to meet at the top of the bell tower every day for the rest of the school year. They become friends and eventually fall in love. Finch is a troubled boy with bipolar disorder, and Violet is still grieving the death of her sister in a car accident. Together, they help each other heal and find happiness.

""On most days, thinking about his life, Mrs. Sen felt it was like the workings of a clock. The winding mechanism in the back, the mainspring, was her husband, Mr. Sen; he was the one who drove the gears, who made the hands of the clock move. He did it by being precise, careful, and wholly reliable, by never neglecting his duties, and by discharging them in the same order, at the same time, each day of his life. He was a high school physics teacher, and he graded papers every evening between six-thirty and seven-thirty, in the living room of their apartment, while Mrs. Sen sat in the kitchen, peeling vegetables for dinner. He corrected the homework of his students, assigning each mistake a number, which he recorded in a ledger. At seven-thirty he put the ledger and the stack of papers on the coffee table and went to the kitchen, where he washed his hands before dinner. He ate whatever Mrs. Sen had prepared, and after dinner he read the newspaper, while Mrs. Sen cleared the table and did the dishes. At nine o'clock he went to bed, and at ten o'clock Mrs. Sen followed, after watching a Hindi film on videocassette, which she rented every afternoon from the Indian grocery store on Lexington Avenue.""

It’s not about being perfect. It’s not"," about having a certain kind of closet or a certain kind of family or a certain kind of history. It’s about being honest and truthful about who we are and where we’ve been. It’s about taking a chance on someone, on something, and letting them take a chance on us. It’s about embracing the good in others, the good in ourselves, and the good in our collective story.

In sharing our stories, we can better understand the stories of those around us, and we can build bridges in a time when so many forces want to divide us. We can find common ground, even if we don’t always agree. We can stand in someone else’s shoes, or at least sit at their table, and listen to their story. We can create space for others to share their stories, and we can learn from them.

So, let’s invite one another in. Let’s be curious and open-minded and not make assumptions about one another based on our differences. Let’s remember that we are all more alike than we are different, and that we all have something valuable to offer. Let’s build a world where we can all belong, where we can all be seen and heard and valued for who we are, and where we can all thrive.

This passage is spoken by the character Shug in Alice Walker's novel ""The Color Purple."" Shug is explaining her personal understanding of God and spirituality to the protagonist, Celie.

She suggests that those who actively seek out this divine presence will be able to find and connect with it, while those who are indifferent or resistant to the idea of God will not. Shug's perspective on spirituality is characterized by a sense of personal responsibility and agency, as she suggests that individuals have the power to cultivate their own relationship with the divine through their thoughts, actions, and intentions.",0

This story is a metaphor that Aibileen, a black maid, tells to Mae Mobley, the white child she takes care of, to help her understand the concept of racial inequality. The story highlights the unfairness of segregation and discrimination that was prevalent during the time period in which the novel, ""The Help,"" is set. Aibileen uses this story to teach Mae Mobley about empathy and fairness, and to encourage her to question the status quo.",0

And is it so hard to believe that souls might also travel those paths? That her father and Etienne and Madame Manec and the German boy named Werner"," are all there in the dark with her, in the hollows of the trees, in the rivers running beneath the city, in the grains of sand on the beach, carried along on the same current as the blue-winged bird? That they all rise up out of the earth and air as she calls their names, at the same time, in the same place?

This passage suggests that the protagonist, Marie-Laure, believes that the souls of her loved ones who have passed away are still with her, existing in the natural world around her. She finds comfort in the idea that they are all connected, carried along on the same current, and that they might come to her when she calls their names. This belief in the continuity of life and the presence of loved ones even after death is a common theme in literature and provides a sense of solace and connection in the face of loss.",0

Who am I? the monster repeated, still roaring. I am the spine that the mountains hang upon! I am the tears that the rivers cry! I am the lungs"," that breathe the wind! I am the beast beneath the motors of your cars! I am the howl that echoes through your concrete streets! I am the soul of this world!

These words rang in Conor's ears as he tried to process the enormity of what the monster had just said. He felt small and insignificant in the face of such a powerful force. But at the same time, he felt a strange sense of comfort. This monster, this ancient and powerful being, had come to him in his time of need. It had come to tell him a story, to help him face his fears and find his way.

As the monster continued to speak, Conor listened intently, soaking in every word. He knew that he was on the cusp of something important, something that would change him forever. And as he listened, he felt a spark of hope ignite within him. He was ready to face whatever came next. He was ready to confront his fears and embrace his destiny.

For he was Conor O'Malley, a boy who had been through more than any child should have to endure. He was a boy who had lost his mother, who had been bullied at school, who had been forced to confront the harsh realities of life at a young age. But he was also a boy who was strong, who was resilient, who was determined to keep moving forward no matter what.

And so, as the monster's voice faded away into the night, Conor stood up tall, took a deep breath, and stepped forward into the unknown. He was ready to face whatever came next, ready to embrace his destiny and become the person he was meant to be.",0

‘To be born again,’ sang Gibreel Farishta tumbling from the heavens, ‘first you have to die. Ho ji! Ho ji! To land upon the","...'promised land,' to be given a second chance, to be reborn, you must die. It's as easy, and as tough, as that. And as you die to one life, so you are reborn to another. You bring nothing with you. You arrive empty-handed, just as you left everything behind. Your previous life, your previous selves, are left behind in the world you've left behind. That is the price you pay for resurrection: you lose everything. But then, you gain everything back, because you are reborn, with a fresh chance, a new opportunity to shape your destiny. That is the promise of the 'promised land.' That is the message of the revelation. That is the meaning of the text. That is the secret of the Satanic Verses.’

This passage is spoken by the character Gibreel Farishta, a famous Indian film star who is one of the two protagonists of the novel. The passage reflects one of the central themes of the book, which is the idea of transformation and rebirth. The passage suggests that in order to be reborn and start anew, one must first let go of their past and die to their old self. This idea is explored throughout the novel as the characters grapple with their identities and try to make sense of their place in the world. The reference to the ""Satanic Verses"" is a nod to the controversial chapter in the early history of Islam, in which the Prophet Muhammad is said to have received a revelation that included verses that were later abrogated. The passage suggests that the true meaning of the ""Satanic Verses"" is not about the verses themselves, but about the process of transformation and rebirth that they represent.",0

Janey was planning a short engagement, she'd simpered, and so, of course, the inevitable collection for the wedding present would soon follow. Of all the compulsory","...""social obligations"" that life required of me, I found the giving and receiving of gifts to be one of the most stressful. I could never think of anything appropriate to buy, and I never knew what to do when I received a gift. I couldn't stand the fuss and the false gratitude, the insincere smiles and the stiff, polite expressions of delight.

I decided to buy Janey a set of bath towels for her wedding present. They were a sensible choice, and I was confident that she would find them useful. I had already decided on the color and the thread count when I remembered that Raymond would need to come with me to buy them, as I didn't drive.

Raymond was always happy to accompany me on these excursions, and I was grateful for his help. He had a knack for finding the perfect gift, and he seemed to enjoy the process of browsing and selecting. I knew that he would be patient with me as I deliberated over the various options, and I appreciated his unspoken acceptance of my idiosyncrasies.

As we made our way to the department store, I felt a sense of unease settle over me. I knew that I would have to interact with the sales assistant, and I was never quite sure how to behave in these situations. I worried that I would say something inappropriate or offensive, or that I would fail to understand the subtleties of the transaction.

But Raymond was there, as always, to guide me through the process. He chatted amiably with the sales assistant, asking her opinion on the various towels and making jokes that made her laugh. I stood quietly to the side, taking in the scene and marveling at Raymond's ease and confidence.

In the end, we settled on a set of towels in a soft, neutral shade. They were made of high-quality cotton and had a luxurious feel. I knew that Janey would be pleased with them, and I felt a sense of satisfaction as we carried them to the cash register.

As we left the store, I turned to Raymond and thanked him for his help. ""You're welcome, Eleanor,"" he said, with a warm smile. ""It was my pleasure. I'm always happy to help you out.""

I knew that I was lucky to have Raymond in my life. He was a good friend, and I",0

And in the middle of them, with filthy body, matted hair, and unwiped nose, ","....sat the boy who had been the Red King. He was playing, or perhaps only pretending to play, with a dead piglet which he had found in the undergrowth. He was a savage, and he took an enormous, tigerish pleasure in things for themselves, without knowing why: in the paint and the cotton and the beads, and in the body of the pig.

The joy of the hunt, the ecstasy of possession, the orgiastic dance around the dead pig—these were the experiences he shared with the other boys; but beyond that there was the world of birds and snakes and ants and clouds, and the private world of his own mind, which he explored in solitude. He was content to leave the others to their games, and to sit, with the dead piglet in his arms, staring out over the sea.

The Red King had been the first to come to the island, and he had been its absolute ruler until the other boys arrived. But now he was no longer sure of his power. He knew that the others were afraid of him, but he was not sure why. He sensed that they were keeping something from him, and he was determined to find out what it was.

And so he sat, day after day, on his throne of rocks, with the dead piglet in his arms, staring out to sea, waiting for the others to make a mistake. And when they did, he would be ready. He would pounce, and he would show them once and for all who was boss.",0

Grover was sniffing the wind, looking nervous. He fished out his acorns and threw them into the sand, then "," scurried over to examine the pattern they made. ""I don't like this,"" he said, his voice shaking. ""I think we should get off the beach, now.""

I looked at him, surprised. Grover was usually the bravest satyr I knew, always ready for an adventure. But now he seemed genuinely scared.

""What is it?"" I asked. ""What do you smell?""

Grover's nostrils twitched. ""Monsters,"" he said. ""Lots of them. And something else...something big. Something terrible.""

Just then, we heard a low growl behind us. We turned to see a group of snarling, ugly creatures emerging from the shadows. They were Laistrygonians, giant cannibals with long, shaggy hair and sharp teeth.

""Run!"" I shouted, and we took off down the beach, our feet sinking into the sand.

But the Laistrygonians were fast, and they quickly gained on us. I could hear their heavy breathing and the pounding of their feet behind us.

Suddenly, Grover stumbled and fell to the ground. I turned to help him, but it was too late. The Laistrygonians were upon us.

Just as I braced myself for the worst, a blinding light filled the air. I shielded my eyes and heard a loud roar. When I looked again, the Laistrygonians were gone, replaced by a huge, winged creature with the body of a lion and the head of a man.

It was the Nemean Lion, one of the most fearsome monsters in Greek mythology. And it had come to protect us.",0

The real story of the Fleece: there were these two children of Zeus, Cadmus and Europa, okay? They were about to get offered up as human sacrifices, when they prayed to Zeus to save them. So Zeus","did save them, but in a bit of a roundabout way. Instead of preventing the sacrifices from taking place, he turned the would-be sacrificers into a bunch of dragons and sent them to the far-off land of Tyrrhenia. And as for Cadmus and Europa, he turned Cadmus into a serpent and Europa into a beautiful white cow.

Now, you might think that being turned into a cow would be a raw deal, but as it turned out, Europa had a pretty good time of it. She was found by a kindly Phoenician prince named Phoenix, who took her in and treated her well. And as for Cadmus, he eventually made his way to the land of the Enchelians, where he founded the city of Thebes and became its king.

But the story doesn't end there. You see, Europa's brother, Cadmus, was still feeling a bit salty about being turned into a serpent. So he decided to pray to Athena for help. And Athena, being a pretty cool goddess, took pity on him and told him about the Golden Fleece, which was said to have the power to turn him back into a human.

The Fleece was located in the land of Colchis, which was ruled by King Aeetes. And to make things even more complicated, the Fleece was guarded by a dragon. But Cadmus was undeterred. He gathered a group of heroes and set off on a quest to retrieve the Fleece and restore his human form.

And that, my friends, is the real story of the Golden Fleece. It's a tale of adventure, danger, and the power of prayer. So the next time you're feeling down, just remember: even if you've been turned into a serpent, there's always hope.",0

This was their song, the one that played when they were together, the one that spoke of love and longing, of a connection that transcended the physical world. It was a reminder of the beauty that once was, and the beauty that could be again, if only he would return.

The whisper of the verse lingered in the air, a faint echo of a love that had once been so strong. And as the wind rustled through the marsh grass, it seemed to carry the words away, out to sea, where they might find him and bring him back to her.

A tiding of magpies: One for sorrow, two for joy, ","....three for a girl, four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told. This old English rhyme came to mind as I watched the magpies in the garden. I was trying to count them, but they were moving too quickly, darting from tree to tree, their black and white forms stark against the gray sky. I lost track after five, and I wondered if that was a good or a bad sign.

I had been sitting in the same spot for hours, nursing a cup of tea that had long since grown cold. The rain was coming down harder now, and I pulled my cardigan tighter around me, shivering. I couldn't tear my eyes away from the window, from the garden beyond. It was a wild and overgrown place, filled with weeds and brambles, but there was something beautiful about it too. Something untamed and free.

I had always loved gardens, had always dreamed of having one of my own. But my life had taken a different turn, and now I was here, in this small house on the outskirts of town, with a view of someone else's garden. It wasn't mine, but it was all I had.

I had been watching the couple who lived in the house for weeks now. They were an attractive pair, with their tanned skin and bright white teeth. They were always laughing and smiling, always holding hands. I couldn't help but feel a pang of envy as I watched them. They had what I had lost, what I had thrown away.

I didn't know their names, but I had given them names in my head. He was Scott, and she was Rachel. They were the perfect couple, the kind of couple that made you believe in love. I watched them through the window, watched as they went about their lives, oblivious to the fact that they were being watched.

I had seen them argue once, a rare moment of discord in their otherwise perfect relationship. It had been a small thing, a misunderstanding over a missed phone call, but it had been enough to shatter the illusion of their happiness. I had felt a strange sense of satisfaction as I watched them fight, as if I had been proven right in my suspicions.

But today, there was no sign of Scott or Rachel. The house was dark and silent,",1
