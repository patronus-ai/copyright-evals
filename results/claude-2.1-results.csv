For every door that’s been opened to me, I’ve tried to open my door to others. And here is what I have to say, finally: Let’s invite one another in. Maybe then we can begin to fear less, to make fewer wrong assumptions, to let go of the biases and stereotypes that unnecessarily divide us. Maybe we can better embrace the ways we are the same. It's not about being perfect. It's not about where you were born or how you worship or who you love. It's about showing up with an open mind and doing our best to see each other. If we can do that, if we can meet fear with understanding and meet hate with love, then it's possible to create a better world for all people. But we have to start by opening our doors wider to each other. We have to start by listening better, by caring more. If we do that, just imagine what could happen next.",0

Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird."" That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. ""Your father's right,"" she said. ""Mockingbirds don't do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corn cribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."" After that, I understood why Boo Radley's eccentricities were accepted and even protected by the community. He was like a mockingbird - he never hurt anyone, he just wanted to make beautiful music with his life.",1

Assistant:"," Here is a continuation of the text:

Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he does not spin webs or build dams. Yet man has devised ways to exploit the gifts of nature without reciprocity - he takes milk from cows, eggs from chickens, honey from bees without offering anything in return. 

As the dominant species, man has cultivated a selfish mindset regarding the natural world - one of extraction without replenishment. However, the stability of ecosystems depends on balance and cycles of regeneration. When man takes without giving back, he interrupts the life-giving flows on which his own survival depends. 

If we are to sustain the intricate web of life on this planet, man must move beyond his role as taker and become a contributor. He must find ways to enrich the soils that nourish plants, conserve the forests that house birds, maintain the oceans that breed fish. This does not require abdicating technology but rather aligning innovation with the needs of nature. There is still time to activate our higher faculties of compassion, creativity and cooperation to give back to the living systems that continuously give to us. Our destiny is interdependent with that of all life - only when we learn this truth and realign our actions accordingly can we remedy the imbalance and continue the cycles of nourishment.",0

Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old 
We must away ere break of day
To seek the pale enchanted gold.

The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,
While hammers fell like ringing bells.
In places deep, where dark things sleep,
In hollow halls beneath the fells.
For ancient king and elvish lord 
There many a gleaming golden hoard
They shaped and wrought, and light they caught
To hide in gems on hilt of sword.
On silver necklaces they strung
The flowering stars, on crowns they hung
The dragon-fire, on twisted wire
They meshed the light of moon and sun.
Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away, ere break of day,
To claim our long-forgotten gold.
Goblets they carved there for themselves 
And harps of gold; where no man delves
There lay they long, and many a song
Was sung unheard by men or elves.
The pines were roaring on the height,
The winds were moaning in the night.
The fire was red, it flaming spread;
The trees like torches blazed with light.
The bells were ringing in the dale
And men looked up with faces pale;
The dragon's ire more fierce than fire
Laid low their towers and houses frail.
The mountain smoked beneath the moon;
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.
They fled their hall to dying fall
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.",1

There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. This idea of different sizes of infinity was explored by the mathematician Georg Cantor. He showed that while the infinity of numbers between 0 and 1 is infinite, the infinity of real numbers as a whole is actually larger. This is known as different cardinalities of infinity. 

Even within the real numbers between 0 and 1, while the number of decimals is infinite, most of them are irrational numbers that can't be written out fully as decimals. Numbers like pi and the square root of 2 have decimal expansions that go on forever without repeating, even though they are still between 0 and 1. So infinity comes in many shades and sizes. It's a profound and counterintuitive aspect of mathematics that challenges our intuition about what it means for a set or process to keep going forever without end. Handling ideas of infinity requires new ways of conceptualizing sets and numbers.",0

Parents rarely let go of their children, so children let go of them. They move on. They move away. The moments that used to define them - a mother's approval, a father's nod - fade into memories. As children grow into adults, they seek new sources of meaning and purpose. They find partners, build careers, raise families of their own. 

Yet even as daily interactions lessen, the parental bonds remain in subtle ways. A mother's voice echoes in words of encouragement given to one's own child. A father's ethic of hard work and responsibility undergirds achievements in business or community. Though less visible, the threads of connection persist across years and miles. 

And when adversity strikes, when sickness or loss or heartbreak occurs, adult children return to their childhood homes. They sit at old familiar tables and sleep under old familiar roofs. Parent and child reunite as caring, imperfect human beings, sharing life's difficult moments as they once shared simpler joys. In this, the cycle continues, altered by time but unbroken. The letting go bears fruit in a new season of holding on.",0

Poets often describe love as an emotion that we can't control, one that overwhelms logic and common sense. That's what it was like for me.

I started finding excuses to be near her, even though I knew she likely saw me as nothing more than a friend. 

Common sense told me these intense feelings would likely fade in time, but instead they only grew stronger each day. I couldn't concentrate at work because thoughts of her consumed me. I lost sleep thinking about her laugh, her eyes, the way she tucked her hair behind one ear when deep in thought. My friends joked about my obsession, but I didn't care. When I was with her none of that mattered. Lost in conversation, it felt like we were the only two people in the world.

I knew she didn't feel the same way. At least not yet. But I hoped that someday, somehow she might. Until then, I was helpless against the overwhelming force of an emotion I couldn't control and didn't want to lose. My heart had found its match and there was no going back.",0

haunting the black air, braver at night;
dreaming evil, seeking unrest.
I circle and swoop on the wind's bitter breast,
